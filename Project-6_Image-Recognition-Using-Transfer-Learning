# Image Recognition using Transfer Learning (ResNet-50)

##  Project Description
This project focuses on building an end-to-end image recognition system using deep learning and transfer learning techniques. A pre-trained ResNet-50 model was used to classify images into multiple categories.

##  Key Concepts Used
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Transfer Learning
- Data Augmentation
- Image Preprocessing
- Model Evaluation

##  Dataset
A publicly available image dataset was used for training and evaluation. Images were resized and normalized before being fed into the model.

##  Model Architecture
- Pre-trained ResNet-50 (ImageNet weights)
- Global Average Pooling
- Fully Connected Dense Layers
- Dropout Regularization

##  Results
- Test Accuracy: ~25–32%
- The model shows correct learning behavior with scope for improvement through extended training and fine-tuning.

##  Future Improvements
- Training for more epochs
- Advanced fine-tuning
- Trying lightweight architectures like MobileNetV2
- Hyperparameter tuning

##  Tools & Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Kaggle Notebook
- NumPy, Matplotlib
