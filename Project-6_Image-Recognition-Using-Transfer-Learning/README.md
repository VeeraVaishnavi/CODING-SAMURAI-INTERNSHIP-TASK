# Image Recognition using Transfer Learning (ResNet-50)

##  Project Description
This project implements an end-to-end image recognition system using transfer learning with a pre-trained ResNet-50 model.

##  Key Concepts Used
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Transfer Learning
- Data Augmentation
- Image Preprocessing
- Model Evaluation

##  Dataset
A publicly available image dataset was used. Images were resized and normalized before training.

##  Model Architecture
- ResNet-50 (ImageNet weights)
- Global Average Pooling
- Dense layers
- Dropout for regularization

##  Results
- Test Accuracy: ~25–32%
- Performance can be improved with extended training and fine-tuning.

##  Future Improvements
- More epochs
- Fine-tuning deeper layers
- Trying lightweight architectures

##  Tools & Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Kaggle Notebook
