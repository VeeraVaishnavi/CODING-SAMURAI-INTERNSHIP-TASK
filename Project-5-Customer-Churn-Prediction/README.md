## Objective
To predict whether a customer will churn based on behavioral and demographic data.

## Dataset
IBM Telco Customer Churn Dataset  
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yeanzc/telco-customer-churn-ibm-dataset

## Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Classification modeling

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression (Baseline)
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

## Results
- Logistic Regression Accuracy: 92%
- ANN Recall (Churn = 1): 94%

## Conclusion
The ANN model was effective in identifying churned customers with high recall,
while Logistic Regression provided balanced and interpretable performance.
